    ```
3. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/chkilel/oc-lando-setup.git .
    ```

4. Modify the APP name in the .lando.yml file, the APP name, must be unique, check the exitance of the APP by running `lando list --all` befor starting the APP, See comments in the file.
    ```yaml
    name: nameOfTheApp # MUST BE MODIFIED BEFOR FIRING UP THE LOCAL DEV ENVIRONMENT
    ```

5. Start the APP by running
    ```shell
    $ lando start
    ```
    After the local dev fire up, you will see

        # Install a plugin from a git repository. The plugin will be cloned
        # into your local repository and become part of it. You can change the
        # plugin and modify it to your needs. It won't be checked out again (no updates).
        # - OFFLINE.Mall (https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin.git)
        
        # The ^ marks this plugin as updateable. It will be removed and checked out again
        # during each call to `october install`. Local changes will be overwritten.
        # This plugin will stay up to date with the changes of your original plugin repo.
        # - ^OFFLINE.Mall (https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin.git)

        #Run lando info and check host in 
        #           external_connection: {
        #               host: 'localhost',
        #               port: '32939'
        #           },
    mail:

        # Must be checked in every start of the Dev Environment because the "port" change
        # Or Change it to mail.YOUR_LANDO_APP_NAME.lndo.site like the example below
        # See proxy.mailhog in the .lando.yml file

        address: chkilel@cheha.bi
        driver: sendmail
    ```

8. When you are done editing your configuration file, simply run `october install` to install October. **oc-bootstrapper** will take care of setting everything up for you. You can run this command locally after checking out a project repository or during deployment.
This command is idempotent, it will only install what is missing on subsequent calls.
    ```shell
    $ lando october install
    ```
    Use the --help flag to see all available options.

    ```shell
    lando october install --help
    ````

9. If at any point in time you need to **install additional plugins**, simply add them to your october.yaml and re-run `october install`. Missing plugins will be installed.

10. If you want to **update the installation** you can run
    ```shell
    $ lando october update
    ```

11. To push local changes to the current **git remote** run
    ```shell
    $ lando october push
    ```

***
# If you are actively developing a site and would like to get the latest and greatest changes for October when updating, then

12. Change the following config files

    - **config/app.php**
     ```php
     'name' => 'October CMS' // Your App/Site name
     ```

    - **config/cms.php**
    ```php
    edgeUpdates = true // Enables updating plugins not managed by composer to their edge (develop) versions
    backendTimezone = 'UTC' // Whatever timezone most of your backend users will find useful as a default
    disableCoreUpdates = true // Disables updating the core through the backend interface, this should be managed by composer only
    ```

12. Run the script below 
    ```shell
    $ ./setupDev.sh
    ```
    If needed, make it executable
    ```shell
    $ chmod +x setupDev.sh
    ```
